"""Fallback plan reviewer over any OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint.

Part of the claudex-loop quota-exhaustion protocol (see FALLBACK.md). Invoked
ONLY after the user explicitly chose to switch reviewers — never automatically,
never silently. Configuring a chain order in CLAUDEX_REVIEWERS is that consent
in standing form: `--chain` walks the configured order and REPORTS every
provider it skipped and why; it never invents a reviewer the user did not list.

Safety model (the two findings from issue #7, addressed by construction):

1. "Read-only" is not read off vendor docs — it is structural. The model gets
   NO file or tool access at all: the plan (and optionally the review log so
   far) is inlined into the prompt, the reply is text. There is nothing to
   escalate, so per-vendor sandbox audits are unnecessary.
2. Rubber-stamping does not count. A reply must end with a VERDICT line, and
   an APPROVED in round 1 with fewer than --min-findings numbered findings is
   treated as an INVALID review (exit 3), not as an approval.

Plan-hash binding: the SHA256 of the plan file is stamped into the verdict
header. A verdict is only valid for exactly that plan state; editing the plan
afterwards self-demotes the approval.

Configuration is environment-driven (process env, plus a `.env` file in the
working directory if present). Reviewers are named profiles:

    CLAUDEX_REVIEWERS=lmstudio,openrouter          # chain order, first = default
    CLAUDEX_REVIEWER_LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1
    CLAUDEX_REVIEWER_LMSTUDIO_MODEL=qwen/qwen3.8-27b
    CLAUDEX_REVIEWER_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
    CLAUDEX_REVIEWER_OPENROUTER_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-r1
    CLAUDEX_REVIEWER_OPENROUTER_API_KEY_ENV=OPENROUTER_API_KEY

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works: LM Studio, Ollama, OpenRouter, OpenAI,
Google Gemini (…/v1beta/openai) and Anthropic (api.anthropic.com/v1) included.
See .env.example for ready-made profiles.

Egress, in three tiers — plain http reaches loopback only in all of them. The
plan and the whole review log travel in that request, so the old rule ("no
cleartext *if a key is set*") had it backwards and left keyless endpoints
unprotected.

1. Nothing configured: the scheme rule alone. Stdlib-only, the default.
2. CLAUDEX_EGRESS_ALLOW=host,host — an exact-match host list. No wildcards and
   no suffixes: `api.openai.com.attacker.test` ends in an allowed name.
3. A file allowlist — CLAUDEX_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST=<path>, or `config/allowed_egress.yaml`
   at the repo root, whose mere presence is the opt-in. Per-host schemes and a
   place to write down WHY a host is listed. **Fail-closed:** if the file is
   named but missing, unparseable, or PyYAML is not installed, nothing is sent.
   Not installing the parser does not lift the restriction. This is the only
   tier that needs a dependency, and only for whoever chooses it.

Preflight (`--check`, and automatically per provider in `--chain`): local
endpoints (127.0.0.1/localhost) only need to be reachable; remote providers
get an auth-validity probe (GET /models), and OpenRouter — the only listed
provider with a real balance API — additionally reports remaining credits via
GET /credits. OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic expose no balance endpoint: exhaustion
there only shows up as HTTP 429/402 on use, which the chain treats as
terminal for that provider and moves on.

Usage:
    python scripts/fallback_review.py --plan PLAN.md [--reviewer NAME | --chain]
        [--log PLAN-REVIEW-LOG.md] [--round N] [--out verdict.txt]
        [--min-findings 3] [--list] [--check]

Exit codes: 0 = valid review with verdict; 2 = config/transport error (or, in
--chain mode, every configured provider failed preflight or errored); 3 =
invalid review (no verdict line, or rubber-stamp suspicion). Never treat exit
2/3 as an approval.
