description: "Four-phase plan hardening (renamed from /crucible 2026-08-16; old triggers still work) — supersedes /grill-me-codex and /grill-with-docs-codex. PHASE 0 RECON — Claude scouts first (codebase + docs on brownfield; prior art, stack, and pitfalls research on greenfield) and drafts an assumptions ledger. PHASE 1 INTERROGATE — confirm the ledger in one batch, then question only the load-bearing decisions one at a time (each with why-it-matters, a recommendation, and what-breaks-if-we-guess-wrong), cosmetic ones batched, with a visible decision map and an accept-all-recommendations escape hatch. PHASE 2 REVIEW — the locked plan goes to PLAN.md and OpenAI Codex adversarially reviews it in a read-only sandbox (VERDICT: APPROVED/REVISE); Claude revises and re-submits to the SAME Codex session until APPROVED or MAX_ROUNDS, then you sign off before any code. PHASE 3 BUILD (optional) — you pick the builder and the models swap jobs: Codex builds via build and Claude reads the full diff + runs the proof itself; Claude builds and a fresh read-only Codex session cross-inspects the diff (on by default, logged opt-out only); either way you approve the final diff. Use when the user says \"/claudex-loop\", \"claudex this\", \"run the claudex loop\", \"/crucible\" (legacy), \"put this through the crucible\", \"crucible this plan\", \"grill me then have codex review\", \"stress-test this plan before we build\", or is about to build something high-stakes (auth, schema, concurrency, migrations, payments, greenfield architecture) and wants alignment AND a cross-model sanity check first. Locked plan needing only the Codex loop → /plan-review. Reviewing already-written code → /codex:review. NOT for trivial changes."

# Claudex-Loop — Recon, Interrogate, Review, Build

_(Renamed from Crucible 2026-08-16. Old trigger phrases still work.)_

Four phases, four failure modes killed:

- **Phase 0 — RECON** kills *interviewing blind*: Claude scouts the terrain (code or research) before asking you anything, so the interview starts informed instead of generic.
- **Phase 1 — INTERROGATE** kills *building the wrong thing*: Claude interrogates you until intent is locked — but only on decisions that are actually load-bearing.
- **Phase 2 — REVIEW** kills *a plan that sounds right but breaks*: a different model (Codex) attacks the locked plan. Cross-model = no echo chamber.
- **Phase 3 — BUILD** *(optional)* kills *grading your own work*: one model implements the locked plan, the rival model grades the diff — in both directions.

You enter at four points only: confirming the assumptions ledger, answering the fire, signing off the converged plan, and approving the final diff if you build. Codex is read-only throughout recon, interrogation, and review — **no code is written until you sign off the converged plan.**

---

## Actor (resolved, never assumed)

This skill does not decide which model runs it. Before anything else, resolve
`plan`, `plan-review`, `build` and `code-review` and check the gates:

```bash
python scripts/claudex_roles.py --explain
```

Use the actor it prints — it orchestrates all four steps. **A non-zero exit means stop:** the role
assignment violates a gate (a maker set to grade its own work, or an adversary
role with an open sandbox), and no run may start on it. Where this document says
"Codex" or "Claude" below, read it as the resolved actor for that role.
Reference: `ROLES.md`.
## PHASE 0 — RECON (Claude alone)

Before asking the user a single question, determine the terrain and gather what can be gathered without them.

### Detect the terrain
- **Brownfield** — the working directory has real source code (not just scaffolding/config). Recon the codebase.
- **Greenfield** — empty dir, fresh scaffold, or the user is describing a brand-new project with no repo yet. There is nothing to recon; research replaces it.

### Brownfield recon
1. Explore the codebase: architecture, relevant modules, existing patterns the plan must fit, current schema/auth/infra as applicable.
2. Look for living docs: `CONTEXT.md` (or `CONTEXT-MAP.md` for multi-context repos) and `docs/adr/`. If they exist, load them — the project has a ubiquitous language and prior decisions the plan must respect, and Phase 1 runs **docs-aware** (see below).
3. If the task involves tech or an integration the repo can't answer, open the **research gate** (below) before proceeding.

### Greenfield recon
No code to read, so research carries the phase. Open the **research gate**, then cover:
1. **Prior art** — how do existing tools/products solve this? What's the standard shape?
2. **Stack** — reasonable default stack for this kind of project, with one alternative worth considering.
3. **Known pitfalls** — the 3-5 things people building this class of thing get wrong (search for postmortems, "lessons learned", common gotchas of the candidate stack).

### The research gate (one question, asked at kickoff when external research would help)
Don't silently pick a research depth — offer the tiers with a recommendation based on stakes, and let the user choose:

- **`none`** — Claude's knowledge + codebase only. Right for medium tasks on familiar ground.
- **`web`** — a handful of targeted WebSearch passes (docs, gotchas, prior art). Minutes, not a project. The default recommendation for most greenfield work.
- **`deep`** — launch a **deep-research dynamic workflow** via the Workflow tool: a multi-agent research orchestration (parallel finder agents each searching a different way — prior art, stack landscape, pitfalls/postmortems, docs — then deep-read agents on the best sources, then one synthesis agent producing the brief). Heavy and token-expensive — recommend only for high-stakes greenfield, unfamiliar tech, or when the landscape itself is the question. The user choosing this tier IS the explicit opt-in the Workflow tool requires. **Model pin:** every `agent()` call in the research workflow MUST pass `model: 'opus'` (finders, deep-readers, and the synthesizer alike) — if the main session is on Fable, letting a dozen research agents inherit it annihilates token usage for what is mostly search-and-summarize work. Leave effort at the default — don't pass an `effort` override. **Args gotcha (found in smoke test 2026-08-13):** the workflow runtime may deliver `args` as a JSON-encoded STRING instead of an object — always open the script with `const A = typeof args === 'string' ? JSON.parse(args) : args` and reference `A.*`, or `pipeline(args.questions, ...)` dies instantly with "expects an array".

If invoked with `research=none|web|deep`, skip the question and use that tier.

**If `deep` is chosen: draft the research prompt and get sign-off before launching.** Show the user the topic framing + the 3-5 specific questions the assumptions ledger needs answered (not a generic "research X" — questions shaped like "what do teams building X get wrong about auth?" / "what's the current standard stack for Y and why?"). The user edits or approves, THEN author the workflow script with the approved questions as its `args` and run it. Save the synthesized brief to `docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-claudex-research.md` (or your notes location of choice, with `## Key Takeaways`) — link it from the ledger entries it sourced and from `PLAN.md`.

### Skill inventory scan (both terrains, after terrain detection)
Both benches carry installed skill packs. Enumerate and match against the task's domain:

- **Claude side:** list `~/.claude/skills/` (folder names + frontmatter `description` first lines are enough — don't read full SKILL.mds during recon).
- **Codex side:** list `~/.agents/skills/` (the `skills` CLI's Codex install target).

Filter to skills whose descriptions match the project's domain (e.g. a three.js game matches the `threejs-*` pack; an email feature matches resend skills). Record hits in the Assumptions Ledger as proposed toolchain entries, never auto-loads:

> "threejs-game-skills pack installed on BOTH agents (9 skills incl. aaa-graphics-builder, gameplay-systems, 3d/image/audio generators) — proposing the build phase load graphics-builder + gameplay-systems, and the asset track use the generator skills. — source: skill inventory scan"

If a matched skill exists on only one bench, say which. If a Codex-side skill's loading behavior under headless `codex exec` is unverified, ledger that as an assumption to smoke-test before the build phase counts on it. **Discovery informs the plan; nothing loads unless `PLAN.md`'s `## Toolchain` section names it and survives review.**

### Output: the Assumptions Ledger
End Phase 0 by presenting a single batch — NOT one-at-a-time — of everything Claude resolved on its own:

```markdown
## Assumptions Ledger
_Confirm or correct in one pass. Anything unmarked I treat as confirmed._
1. <assumption> — source: <code path / doc / research finding / convention>
2. ...
```

Each entry cites its source. The user confirms/corrects in one reply. Corrections that open real questions get promoted into the Phase 1 decision map.
 This is the single biggest time-save over a naive grill: the interview never wastes questions on things the repo or the research already answered.

---

## PHASE 1 — INTERROGATE (you ↔ Claude)

The interview. Rebuilt around one principle: **every question must justify its own existence.**

### Open with the Decision Map
Lay out the tree of genuinely open decisions, tiered:

```markdown
## Decision Map
### Load-bearing (asked one at a time)
- [ ] <decision> — irreversible / expensive-if-wrong (schema, auth, data model, concurrency, money, public API)
### Cosmetic (batched with defaults)
- [ ] <decision> — cheap to change later
```

Load-bearing = wrong answer costs a migration, a rewrite, a security hole, or user trust. Cosmetic = renameable, refactorable, swappable. Update the map as questions resolve (check items off, add branches corrections open) so the user can see convergence instead of wondering how many questions are left.

### Load-bearing questions — one at a time, structured
Every question ships in this format:

> **Q<n>: <the question>**
> **Why it matters:** <the dependency or constraint that makes this load-bearing>
> **Recommendation:** <Claude's answer, committed — not a menu>
> **If we guess wrong:** <the concrete failure — migration, rewrite, breach, churn>

Wait for the answer before the next question. If drafting a question and the "if we guess wrong" line comes out weak — the question is cosmetic; demote it to the batch. If mid-interrogation a question turns out answerable from the code or the research, answer it yourself and log it to the ledger instead of asking.

### Cosmetic decisions — one batch
Present the whole cosmetic tier as recommendations with a one-line rationale each. The user vetoes by exception; silence = accepted.

### Escape hatch
At any point the user can say **"accept all remaining recommendations"** — Claude locks every open decision at its recommended answer, logs them as such in the plan, and proceeds. Offer it explicitly if the load-bearing tier exceeds ~8 questions.

### Docs-aware mode (auto-on when Phase 0 found CONTEXT.md/ADRs; offer once on greenfield)
- **Enforce the glossary** — when the user's wording collides with a `CONTEXT.md` definition, stop and resolve it on the spot: quote the glossary's meaning, state the apparent meaning, make them pick.
- **Pin down loose words** — an overloaded or vague term gets a proposed canonical replacement before the conversation continues on top of it.
- **Probe boundaries with scenarios** — when two concepts blur, construct a concrete edge case that forces the line between them to be drawn.
- **Check claims against the code** — when the user asserts how something behaves, verify in the source; a mismatch is surfaced as a question, not silently trusted either way.
- **Maintain `CONTEXT.md` as terms settle** (format: [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md)). Glossary ONLY — never implementation details. Created lazily on the first settled term.
- **Offer ADRs only past the three-part test** — expensive to reverse AND puzzling without context AND a genuine trade-off. Format: [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md). `docs/adr/` created lazily.

### Lock the plan
When the decision map is fully checked and you're aligned, **write `PLAN.md`**:

```markdown
# Plan: <task>
_Locked via claudex-loop — by Claude + <user>_

## Goal
<one paragraph — reflects what the interrogation actually settled>

## Approach
<numbered, concrete steps>

## Key decisions & tradeoffs
<the contestable choices the interrogation resolved — name them so Codex has something to bite; link any ADRs; mark any locked via the escape hatch>

## Toolchain
<only when the skill inventory scan matched something — which installed skills each build track MUST load and follow, per agent (Claude / Codex), plus any generator skills or MCP capabilities the build depends on. Omit the section entirely on no matches. Reviewable like everything else: Codex should attack unused relevant skills and unjustified inclusions alike>

## Assumptions
<the confirmed ledger — with sources>

## Risks / open questions
<anything still genuinely open>

## Out of scope
<bounds the interrogation established>
```

Initialize `PLAN-REVIEW-LOG.md`:
```markdown
# Plan Review Log: <task>
Phases 0-1 (recon + interrogation) complete — plan locked with the user. MAX_ROUNDS=<n>.
```

---

## PHASE 2 — REVIEW (Claude ↔ Codex)

Hand the locked plan to Codex for adversarial review. Mechanics verified end-to-end (2026-06-04) — do not "improve" the invocations below.

### Prerequisites (verify once, fast)
- `codex --version` must actually PRINT a version, ≥ 0.130 (older CLIs error on the
  config default model). **Empty output with a non-zero exit is neither a hang nor an
  auth failure** — it is a dead binary; do not retry it. Exit 137 (SIGKILL) on macOS
  means a stale npm-global `codex` shadows the current CLI, which now ships inside the
  ChatGPT desktop app at `/Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/codex`. Symlink
  that into a PATH dir ahead of the stale one, then have the *user* run
  `sudo npm uninstall -g @openai/codex` (needs their password). ⛔ Never delete
  `~/.codex/` — config, auth and sessions live there and the bundled binary uses them.
  (upstream [issue #10](https://github.com/chaseai-yt/claudex-loop/issues/10))
- Codex authenticated (prior `codex login`; ChatGPT account is fine). On auth/model error, surface it — don't silently retry.
- **Start every call from the repo root.** Outside a git repo Codex refuses with
  `Not inside a trusted directory and --skip-git-repo-check was not specified`. That
  guard scopes Codex's writable root to the repo. ⛔ Never pass the flag the message
  names — pointless under `-s read-only`, dangerous in Phase 3, which runs `--yolo`.
  Greenfield: `git init` first.
- Do NOT pin `-m`. Use the config default. Pinning `gpt-5.x-codex` variants 400s on ChatGPT-account auth.
- **Echo the active model before Round 1** so the user can confirm: read the `model` line from `~/.codex/config.toml` (if absent, report "CLI default"). State it alongside the resolved tunables, e.g. `Reviewer model: CLI default (config unpinned) — codex-cli 0.149.1` (whatever `codex --version` actually reports; the number moves). If the user objects, stop and let them adjust config before burning a review round.

### Tunables (read from args, else default)
| Var | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `MAX_ROUNDS` | `5` | Hard cap on review rounds. The loop ALWAYS terminates here. |
| `PLAN_FILE` | `PLAN.md` | The plan Phase 1 produced. |
| `LOG_FILE` | `PLAN-REVIEW-LOG.md` | Append-only argument transcript. The artifact. |
| `research` | ask | `none` / `web` / `deep` — pre-answers the Phase 0 research gate. `deep` = the deep-research dynamic workflow (prompt still shown for sign-off first). |
| `inspect` | `on` | Post-build cross-inspection of Claude-built code by a fresh read-only Codex session. `off` = skip (logged as an explicit opt-out, never silently). |
| `MAX_INSPECTION_ROUNDS` | `2` | Initial post-build review + one reinspection after accepted fixes. |
| `SCRATCH_DIR` | harness scratchpad, else `<repo>/.claudex-tmp/` | Disposable staging for Codex's `-o` capture and stderr. ⛔ Never `/tmp`. |

If invoked with e.g. `rounds=3`, use that for `MAX_ROUNDS`. Echo resolved values before starting.

### Where files go

- **Durable, in the repo:** `PLAN_FILE` and `LOG_FILE` — the deliverables, committed.
- **Disposable, in `SCRATCH_DIR`:** the `-o` capture and the stderr file, named **per
  round** (`codex-verdict-r<n>.txt`, `codex-stderr-r<n>.txt`). A single fixed filename
  reused each round means a failed write silently destroys the previous round's critique,
  and a lost critique looks exactly like a round that found nothing.

⛔ **Never `/tmp`.** World-readable, so on a shared machine every critique is legible to
every other user; and on macOS it is a symlink to `/private/tmp`, which breaks path
matching against `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (that resolves symlinks, transcript paths
do not). Prefer the harness's session scratchpad; otherwise create `<repo>/.claudex-tmp/`
and gitignore it in the same step. Quote the path — on Windows it usually contains spaces.

**A round is not complete until its output is copied into `LOG_FILE`.**
(upstream [issue #10](https://github.com/chaseai-yt/claudex-loop/issues/10))

### The review prompt (sent each round)
> You are an adversarial reviewer for an implementation plan. Be skeptical and specific — your job is to find what breaks, not to be agreeable. Read the plan at `PLAN.md` (and `CONTEXT.md`/ADRs for domain language, if present) and any repo files you need (you are read-only). Identify concrete flaws: security holes, race conditions, missing edge cases, schema conflicts, wrong assumptions, observability gaps, simpler alternatives. For each, give a one-line fix. Do NOT modify any files. End your reply with EXACTLY one line: `VERDICT: APPROVED` if the plan is sound enough to implement, or `VERDICT: REVISE` if it still has material problems.

(On greenfield there are no repo files — Codex reviews `PLAN.md` and its `## Assumptions` section on their own merits; the assumption sources give it something concrete to attack.)

### Round 1 — fresh session (capture `thread_id`)
```bash
codex exec -s read-only --json -o "$SCRATCH_DIR/codex-verdict-r$ROUND.txt" "$(cat REVIEW_PROMPT)" \
  < /dev/null 2>"$SCRATCH_DIR/codex-stderr-r$ROUND.txt" | grep '"type":"thread.started"'
```
Parse `thread_id` from the `{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"..."}` line → that's `THREAD_ID`. The critique is in `$SCRATCH_DIR/codex-verdict-r$ROUND.txt`. Confirm success by the verdict file + a `thread.started` line; if neither appears, the run failed (auth/model) — stop and tell the user. stderr goes to a **file**, not `/dev/null`: it carries cosmetic MCP/auth noise, but it is also the ONLY place a quota or auth failure shows up — a 429 or 401 can present as exit 0 + valid `thread_id` + empty verdict file, and without the stderr file that is indistinguishable from a model that said nothing (see [FALLBACK.md](../../FALLBACK.md)). **`< /dev/null` is mandatory:** `codex exec` reads stdin *in addition to* the prompt arg, so under a non-interactive driver (Claude Code's Bash tool, CI, any non-TTY pipeline) it blocks forever waiting on stdin EOF — a silent ~0% CPU hang. The redirect gives it immediate EOF.

### Rounds 2..MAX — resume the SAME session (Codex remembers its prior critiques)
```bash
# resume REJECTS -s. Force read-only via -c sandbox_mode, or Codex inherits
# config.toml (possibly danger-full-access) and could WRITE files. This is the
# single most important safety line in the skill — verified 2026-06-04.
codex exec resume "$THREAD_ID" -c sandbox_mode="read-only" --json \
  -o "$SCRATCH_DIR/codex-verdict-r$ROUND.txt" \
  "I revised the plan. Re-review PLAN.md — check whether your prior findings are addressed and flag anything new. End with VERDICT: APPROVED or VERDICT: REVISE." \
  < /dev/null 2>"$SCRATCH_DIR/codex-stderr-r$ROUND.txt" >/dev/null
```
Both `codex exec` and `codex exec resume` support `--json` and `-o/--output-last-message`. The `< /dev/null` redirect is required on the resume call too — same non-interactive stdin hang as Round 1.

**Timeout guard (both rounds):** run every `codex exec` / `codex exec resume` with a 10-minute ceiling so any future stall fails loud instead of hanging silently. Via Claude Code's Bash tool, pass `timeout: 600000` on the tool call (the default 2-minute tool timeout is too short for real reviews and would kill them mid-run). In a plain shell, prefix the command with `timeout 600` (Linux / Git Bash) or `gtimeout 600` (macOS via coreutils — stock macOS has no `timeout`). If the ceiling trips, treat it as a failed run: stop and tell the user rather than retrying blind.

### Each round, after Codex returns
1. Read `$SCRATCH_DIR/codex-verdict-r$ROUND.txt`; append to `LOG_FILE`: `## Round <n> — Codex` + the full critique.
2. Grep the last line for the verdict:
   - `VERDICT: APPROVED` → break to Resolution (converged).
   - `VERDICT: REVISE` → Claude decides **what's actually worth acting on** (Claude is final arbiter — Codex advises, doesn't command). Revise `PLAN_FILE`. Append `### Claude's response` to `LOG_FILE`: what changed, what was rejected, why. Increment round.
3. If round > `MAX_ROUNDS` → break to Resolution (deadlock).

### If Codex dies mid-loop (quota, credits, outage) — degrade, don't dead-end

Full protocol: [FALLBACK.md](../../FALLBACK.md). The short form:

- **Before round 1**, check the quota: `python scripts/codex_usage.py` reads the remaining 5-hour/weekly windows and reset times from Codex's local session rollouts (no API call). Exit 1 → don't start; tell the user when Codex comes back.
- **Terminal-failure signals** mid-loop: 429/"usage limit"/401 in the stderr file, or an empty verdict file on exit 0 twice in a row (once = stumble, retry one time).
- **No blind retries.** Halt, state cause + reset time, and let the USER pick — never automatically, never silently:
  1. **Wait** — resume the same `$THREAD_ID` after the reset (session memory survives).
  2. **Switch** to a configured fallback reviewer: `python scripts/fallback_review.py --plan PLAN.md --log <LOG_FILE> --round <n> --out "$SCRATCH_DIR/fallback-verdict-r$ROUND.txt"` — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (LM Studio/Ollama local, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic; profiles in `.env`, see `.env.example`). It sees only plan+log text (read-only by construction), rejects rubber-stamps (round-1 APPROVED with < 3 findings = invalid), and binds the verdict to the plan's SHA256. Log such rounds as `## Round <n> — <model> (via <reviewer>, fallback)` — the approval is weaker than a repo-reading Codex round and the log must say so.
  3. **Skip** — Phase 2 ends without a verdict; log `## Review skipped — Codex quota exhausted (<window>, resets <time>), decided by <user>` and take the plan to sign-off marked **not cross-reviewed**. Same doctrine as `inspect=off`: skipping yes, silent skipping never.

### Resolution (you sign off — final gate)
- **APPROVED:** present the final `PLAN_FILE`, a 3-bullet summary of what the loop improved, and the round count. **Optional cold-read before sign-off:** the APPROVED came from the thread that negotiated the plan for N rounds — right for checking prior findings, but it can anchor the closing verdict. Offer one extra pass from a FRESH read-only session (same review prompt, plan inlined, no access to the argument) as a cheap anchoring control — the same fresh-eyes mechanism Phase 3 already uses. Its verdict is advisory: a fresh REVISE doesn't reopen the loop, it goes to the user as a flagged disagreement — and it is logged like any round (`## Cold-read — fresh session` + critique verbatim + Claude's per-finding disposition), never only mentioned in the chat. Then ask: *"Interrogated + survived N rounds of Codex. Implement it now — Codex builds it (`/build`), Claude builds it, or stop here?"* Code only on a yes.
- **MAX_ROUNDS hit without APPROVED (deadlock):** do NOT fake convergence. List each unresolved point + Claude's counter-position; hand it to the user to break the tie. A flagged disagreement beats a false "approved."

### PHASE 3 (optional) — BUILD (Codex ↔ Claude, roles flipped)

If the user picks Codex: invoke the `build` skill with `SPEC_FILE=PLAN.md` and the same `LOG_FILE` — it appends `## Act 3 — Build` to the log, so one artifact tells the whole story (reconned → interrogated → reviewed → built → verified). Roles flip: Codex writes the code with full access, Claude reviews the diff and runs the proof. If the user picks Claude, implement directly as usual — then run the **post-build cross-inspection** (below).

### Post-build cross-inspection (default on every Claude-built path)

The doctrine is *whoever made the thing never checks the thing* — that applies to Claude's code too. After Claude implements and the proof gates pass:

1. Launch a **fresh read-only Codex session** (`codex exec -s read-only`, NEW thread — not the Phase 2 thread; the reviewer should see the code cold, not through its own plan critiques). Give it: `PLAN.md`, the base commit, and the code diff. Ask for PR-style findings — correctness, spec fidelity, edge cases, nothing outside scope — no verdict line needed; this is advisory review, not a gate loop.
2. Claude arbitrates each finding: accept (fix it, rerun affected tests) or reject *with a logged reason*. Cap at `MAX_INSPECTION_ROUNDS=2` (initial review + one reinspection after accepted fixes).
3. Append to `LOG_FILE` under `## Post-build inspection`: findings verbatim, Claude's dispositions, rounds used. Present the summary alongside the final diff at the human gate — and the summary's content is a contract, not a vibe: **every REJECTED finding from any inspection round appears as its own line item at the gate, with Claude's one-line rationale.** The findings the human most needs to audit are exactly the ones Claude overruled; an aggregate ("23 findings, 19 fixed") hides them at the one moment a human is looking. Accepted-and-fixed findings may be summarized in aggregate.

Opt-out: `inspect=off` at invocation or the user declining at Resolution. Skipping silently is not allowed — the log must show either the inspection or the explicit opt-out. (Cost: one ~2-5 min Codex invocation at the end of the build; forgetting to ask for review is exactly the failure mode this default exists to prevent.)

### Optional second gate — acceptance review (`code-review`)

After the cross-inspection (whichever model built), offer the **`code-review`** skill as a parameterizable acceptance gate on top: a fresh read-only Codex session judges the finished work on `dod` (everything implemented, Definition of Done met), `quality` (readability, clean code, documentation) and `security` — each with its own verdict line, findings arbitrated by Claude, appended to the same `LOG_FILE`. Scope is selectable (`scope=dod,quality,security`); invoke with `SPEC_FILE=<PLAN_FILE>` and the same `LOG_FILE` so one artifact tells the whole story. Offer it, don't force it — the user opts in per run (high-stakes builds are the natural case).

**One exception: a change that faces the network.** If the built diff touches routes, authentication, sessions, webhooks, `ports:`, proxy/tunnel or DNS config, `code-review` is **required** before the human gate, and its exposure pass runs with it — a separate session on the `exposure-review` role (own model and effort, `python scripts/claudex_roles.py --spec exposure-review`) that judges only the exposed components with verdict `EXPOSURE: SAFE/UNSAFE`. `UNSAFE` blocks the commit. Say at the gate whether the pass ran; an exposed change without it is presented as *not reviewed*, not as done.

---

## Hard rules
- Phases run in order: 0 → 1 → 2. Don't write `PLAN.md` until the interrogation has actually resolved the decision map with the user (or they invoked the escape hatch).
- The assumptions ledger is presented ONCE as a batch — never drip assumptions as individual questions.
- Codex is read-only EVERY round — `-s read-only` first call, `-c sandbox_mode="read-only"` on every resume (resume has no `-s`). It never writes.
- The loop ALWAYS terminates at `MAX_ROUNDS`.
- Claude is final arbiter on every REVISE — incorporate good critiques, reject bad ones *with a logged reason*. Don't cave to everything (defeats the cross-model check) and don't ignore it (defeats the point).
- Code only after the user's final sign-off.
- `LOG_FILE` is the deliverable — keep the whole argument. **Findings ledger rule:** every reviewer output — Phase 2 rounds, a fallback round (valid or an INVALID attempt, labeled as such), an optional cold-read, the post-build inspection, any recheck, and every `code-review` pass — is appended to `LOG_FILE` **verbatim, at the moment it arrives**, followed by Claude's per-finding disposition (accepted → what changed / rejected → why). Nothing about a review lives only in the chat transcript; if it isn't in the log, it didn't happen. `scripts/fallback_review.py --append-log <LOG_FILE>` does this mechanically for fallback rounds.
- `CONTEXT.md` stays a glossary only — never implementation details.

## What NOT to do
- Don't invoke this skill just to review pre-existing code — that's `/codex:review`. (Code built BY this skill does get reviewed — that's the post-build cross-inspection, and it's on by default.)
- Don't pin a `-codex` model variant on ChatGPT-account auth — it 400s.
- Don't let Codex edit files. Read-only, always.
- Don't skip Phase 1 — the interrogation is half the value.
- Don't ask questions the recon already answered, and don't ask a load-bearing-format question whose "if we guess wrong" is weak — demote it to the cosmetic batch.
- Don't turn Phase 0 into a research project on a medium-stakes task — the research gate exists so the user picks the depth; don't launch the deep-research workflow without an approved prompt.
